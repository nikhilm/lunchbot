Lunchbot
========

At Mozilla, we have about 30 interns
spread over 3 floors of the office. We often want different types of lunch at different
times, but there was no easy way to co-ordinate this on IRC. Lunchbot tries to solve
this problem.

How
---

All commands require you to explicitly mention lunchbot at the beginning of the line,
either as 'lunchbot:' or 'lunchbot'

1) ask everyone in channel for lunch [IMPLEMENTED]
- spam
ask all ops + a whitelist - a blacklist

2) add yourself to the whitelist (automatically takes you of the blacklist)
- whitelist me

3) add yourself to the blacklist (automatically takes you of the whitelist)
- blacklist me

4) you've already had lunch, so don't bother for the rest of the day (temporary blacklist)
- i had lunch

lunchbot does NOT handle time zones, it better be in the same physical location as everyone else.
